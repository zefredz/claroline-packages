Plugin class specifications
---------------------------

First, defines two protected attributes :

    $toolLabel : the label of the module you want to import
                 Warning: you must use the REAL label!.
    $toolName  : the module's name, as it will appear in the import list.
                 Note: the name can differ from the real tool name.
    
Then, implement the public load() method.

Its role is to harvest datas from tool's database,
and put them in two protected attributes: $itemQueryResult and $dataQueryResult.

$itemQueryResult is an iterator ( usually a Database_ResultSet )
which each line contains the following datas :

    id         : the ID of the importable item in tool database
    title      : The title of the item
    visibility : The item's visibility, expressed in the following format :
                 'visible'/'invisible' or 'VISIBLE'/'INVISIBLE'

$dataQueryResult is an array which contains one or more iterator(s).
Each iterators must have the same content structure :

    user_id : The ID of the user
    item_id : The ID of the item (the same as in $itemQueryresult)
    score   : the score of the user for the item,
              which must be an integer with 0 =< score =< 100
